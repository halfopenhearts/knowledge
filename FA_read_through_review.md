1. Alternate Data Streams - NO OBJECTIVES ?
  ADS was first introduced to NTFS in Windows NT 3.1 and was Microsoft’s attempt at implementing filesystem forks in order to maintain compatibility with other filesystems like Apple’s HFS+ and Novell’s NWFS and NSS.
  In NTFS – files consists of attributes, security settings, mainstreams and alternate streams. By default, only the mainstream is visible.
  ADS has been used to store metadata, like file attributes, icons, image thumbnails.
  Great way to hide data using NTFS.
  Can be scanned by antivirus (Windows Defender Smartscreen is ADS aware).
  Does not change the MD5 hash of the file.
  Deleted once copied to a fat32.
  Cannot be disabled.
