``` example of switching from ps ver 5.1 to and from ps ver 7.3
what version am i using
  get-host | select-object Version

switch to PS Ver 7.3 by typing `pwsh` at the prompt

then run (again)
  get-host | select-object Version

to switch back type exit and get version again

```

There are five Registry Hives

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)
  - values are read every time the machine is started
  - contains configuration information for the entire computer

HKEY_USERS (HKU)
  - Contains all all user profiles on the system. Contains one key per user on the system
  - Each key is named after the SID(Security Identifier) of the user. (how to get sid of user and identify?)

HKEY_CURRENT_USERS (HKCU)
  - is the copy of the logged in user’s registry key based on thier SID from HKEY_USERS.
  -

HKEY_USERS (HIVE)
              └──SID (S-1-5-21-3939661428-3032410992-3449649886-XXXX) (Key)

HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC)
  - is a symbolic link (pointer or shortcut or alias) to the following registry key:
  -
HKEY_Local_Machine (HIVE)
              └──SYSTEM (Key)
                      └──CurrentControlSet (Subkey)
                                    └── Hardware Profiles (Subkey)
                                                └── Current (Subkey)


HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)
  - is a symbolic link (pointer or shortcut or alias) to the following registry key:
  -

HKEY_Local_Machine (HIVE)
              └──Software (Key)
                      └──Classes (Subkey)

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB
This registry key contains information about all USB devices that have been connected to the system at some point

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR
This registry key specifically deals with USB storage devices, such as USB flash drives, external hard drives, etc. It contains information about connected USB storage devices, including details like device instance paths, hardware IDs, and other configuration information.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management
This key maintains Windows virtual memory (paging file) configuration.
The paging file (usually C:\pagefile.sys) may contain evidence/important information that could be removed once the suspect computer is shutdown.

1. Alternate Data Streams - NO OBJECTIVES ?
  ADS was first introduced to NTFS in Windows NT 3.1 and was Microsoft’s attempt at implementing filesystem forks in order to maintain compatibility with other filesystems like Apple’s HFS+ and Novell’s NWFS and NSS.
  In NTFS – files consists of attributes, security settings, mainstreams and alternate streams. By default, only the mainstream is visible.
  ADS has been used to store metadata, like file attributes, icons, image thumbnails.
  Great way to hide data using NTFS.
  Can be scanned by antivirus (Windows Defender Smartscreen is ADS aware).
  Does not change the MD5 hash of the file.
  Deleted once copied to a fat32.
  Cannot be disabled.
