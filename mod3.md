Donovian Database Exploitation (DWDBE)
XX Dec 2026
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Cyberspace Exploitation (C-E)

Objective: Maneuver through network, identify and gather intelligence from the Donovian Logistics Agency database.

Tools/Techniques:
All connections will be established through web browser to donovian-nla.
SSH masquerade to Donovian_Webserver with provide credentials.
Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change.
Web exploitation techniques are limited to SQLi injections. Network scanning tools/technique usage is at the discretion of student.


Prior Approvals:
SQLi injects through web browser.
Creation of database administrator account if directed to.
Any connection to donovian-nla other than HTTP/HTTPs is NOT approved.

SITREP:Your team has been deployed for Operation Golden Nugget, in direct support of Gorgas forces amid the Donovian-Gorgas war. You have been tasked to collect, analyze, and process data utilizing various reconnaissance techniques throughout Donovian and Gorgas Cyberspace.

Maintain 'low visibility' on the wire, as security products may be in place, and document your actions and results as you will be expected to provide OpNotes upon request.

Intelligence believes that not all of the 192.168.28.96/27 network has the ability to communicate with the 192.168.150.224/27 network.

Donovian Reconnaissance and Scanning (DR&S)
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective:Scan target networks to gather pertinent host information.

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through network scans or web browser. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. Network scanning tools/techniques are limited to NSE scripts, python lxml and OSINT.

Scenario Credentials: FLAG = R3C0N5t@rt0F@ct1v1ty

Prior Approvals: OSINT through publicly available resources. Scrape appropriate web content that will provide operational data. Testing of found credentials. NOT approved to change routing, passwords, services, destroy data, upload of tools, create accounts
