masquerading malware as a legit service such as svchost, lsass

always investigate parent pid


process' = running thing
-  a running instance of a program with its own memory space and PID

DLL (dynamic link library)
-  a shared library loaded by a proces to provide functionality

service / daemon = long running thing
-  a long-running background process mananged by the OS, often start at boot


Get-Process | select-Ojbect Name, Id, CPU, WorkingGet
Get-Process smss, csrss, ksass
Get-Process *chrome*


Get-Process chrome | foreach {$_.modules} | more
  - > will find .dll for chrome

C:\windows\system32 - any .dll outside of this DLL is sus

powershell started by word or excel is sus

Get-CimInstance Win32_process - "pretty helpful"

cheat sheet:
tasklist /svc - services to pid
tasklist /m - show loaded DLL' for each process
tasklist / /fi "IMAGENAME eq chrome.exe" - emumerate DLL' for specific process

taskmgr: ctrol + shift + esc
switch todetails tab
sort by pid

peocexp (if available)
view parent/chind tree
ununsial parent process path
dll' tab

services enumeration commands 
_____________________________
sc query
sc queryex type-service
net start

schtasks - persistence ?

Get-Ciminstance Win32_service | Select Name, Processid, Pathname | more

Pipe in ft -wrap to see full file name/path



run keys execute programs at logon
HKLM\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run
HKCU\..same..path..

RunOnce keys execute once, then delete

HKLM\...\RunOnce
HKCU\..,\RunOnce

services persist via registry=nacked configuration
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

per-user persistence via individual hives
HKU\<sid>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

-*HKU DOES NOT NEED ADMIN RIGHTS*-

Get-NetTCPConnection -State Established
- State Listen
- Select LocalPort, RemoteAddress, State, OwningProcess

- Get-Process -Id <PID>

netstat -anob
-a all conections + listenings ports
-n numerical ips and ports
-o owning pid
-b executable responsible for connnection
